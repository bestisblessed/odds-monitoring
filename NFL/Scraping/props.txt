Based on the `nfl_props_scraper.py` script, here's what it scrapes and from where:

What it scrapes: 
NFL betting props (proposition bets) for a specific game.

Where it scrapes from:
The script scrapes from 4 major sportsbooks:

1. Bovada (`bovada.lv`)
   - Tabs scraped:
     - Alternate Lines
     - TD Scorer Props  
     - Passing Props
     - Receiving Props
     - Rushing Props
     - D/ST Props (Defense/Special Teams)
     - Touchdown Props
     - Special Bets
     - Score Props
     - Game Props
   - Data extracted: Player names, teams, prop types, betting lines, over/under odds.

2. MyBookie (`mybookie.ag`) 
   - Data extracted: Prop descriptions, point values, odds, prop types.

3. Hard Rock Bet (`app.hardrock.bet`)
   - Tabs scraped:
     - Game Lines
     - Player Props  
     - Halves
     - Quarters
   - Data extracted: Market headers, selection names, odds.

4. BetOnline (`sports.betonline.ag`)
   - Data extracted: Team names, prop sections, prop types, values.

How it works:
1. Uses Selenium WebDriver with Chrome (headless mode).
2. Uses hardcoded game IDs for each sportsbook (currently set to a specific Cardinals vs Seahawks game).
3. Navigates through different tabs/sections on each site.
4. Extracts betting prop data using BeautifulSoup HTML parsing.
5. Saves data as CSV files with timestamps in `data/props/` directory.

Output:
Creates separate CSV files for each sportsbook/tab combination, like:
- `bovada_passing_props_20240101_123456.csv`
- `mybookieag_nfl_props_20240101_123456.csv` 
- `hard_rock_nfl_props_20240101_123456.csv`
- `betonline_nfl_props_20240101_123456.csv`

The script is designed for comparative odds analysis across multiple sportsbooks for the same NFL game.
