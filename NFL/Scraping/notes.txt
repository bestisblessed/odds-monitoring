HTTP HEADERS EXPLAINED - BEGINNER'S GUIDE
==========================================

Think of HTTP headers like an ID card you show when entering a building. 
Each header tells the website something about who you are and what you want.

ESSENTIAL IDENTITY HEADERS:
---------------------------

1. User-Agent
   - Tells the website what browser and device you're using (proves you're a real browser, not a bot)

2. Accept
   - Lists what file types your browser can handle (HTML, images, etc.)

3. Accept-Language
   - Tells website what languages you prefer (English, Spanish, etc.)

4. Accept-Encoding
   - Says you can handle compressed/zipped content to make pages load faster

SECURITY & CONNECTION HEADERS:
------------------------------

5. DNT (Do Not Track)
   - Asks websites not to track your behavior (shows privacy-conscious user behavior)

6. Connection
   - Reuses the same connection for multiple page requests (more efficient, like real browsers)

7. Upgrade-Insecure-Requests
   - Asks server to use HTTPS instead of HTTP when possible (shows security-conscious behavior)

MODERN SECURITY HEADERS (Sec-Fetch-*):
--------------------------------------
These are newer Chrome security headers that prove you're a legitimate browser:

8. Sec-Fetch-Dest
   - Says what type of content you're requesting (document, image, script, etc.)

9. Sec-Fetch-Mode
   - Describes how you're making the request (navigate, cors, no-cors, etc.)

10. Sec-Fetch-Site
    - Says where the request came from (same-origin, cross-site, none, etc.)

11. Sec-Fetch-User
    - Proves a real person initiated the request (THE BIG ANTI-BOT SIGNAL!)

PERFORMANCE HEADERS:
-------------------

12. Cache-Control
    - Requests the newest version of the page (don't use cached/old content)

WHY ODDSCHECKER NEEDS ALL OF THEM:
---------------------------------

Based on our test results:
- Without Sec-Fetch headers → 403 Blocked (looks like a bot)
- Without User-Agent → 403 Blocked (no browser identity)
- Without Accept headers → 403 Blocked (doesn't look like real browser request)
- With ALL headers → 200 Success ✅

KEY INSIGHT:
-----------
OddsChecker's bot detection looks for COMPLETE browser fingerprints. 
Missing even one expected header makes you look suspicious. 
It's like trying to enter a high-security building - you need ALL the right credentials.

MOST CRITICAL: Sec-Fetch-User: ?1 - This literally says "a human clicked this"!
